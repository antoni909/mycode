CHALLENGE 01 (OPTIONAL) - The last script will return a bunch of card data that is impossible to read.

Write the data into a file
Ensure the data you write into the file is in a format that is EASY for a human to read!
Give the file a name that somehow relates to the files contents (for example, 4DE_cards.set might be a good name for cards returned by the lookup 4de)
CHALLENGE 02 (OPTIONAL) - Find a different API described on https://docs.magicthegathering.io/ and write a script to interact with it. Examples include /types, /supertypes, and /formats.

CHALLENGE 03 (OPTIONAL) - Figure out the Magic The Gathering python SDK. Generally, all SDKs are wrappers that let developers abstract control of a target system. In this case, the MTG SDK allows devs to abstract control of the RESTful API. The SDK is described in better detail here: https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-python

To install the SDK use, python3 -m pip install mtgsdk
CHALLENGE 04 (OPTIONAL) - Find a completely different API to script around. Lots of API sources are available on the internet. Choose one of the following and write a script that uses data returned by the API.
